#### 07/04/2022
1. Quality of Life update
    Previouslywhen recording, all string values for records are all inputted first before their corresponding value. Now, the recording is now done in intervals where the string value is recorded first, then the value, then the loop repeats untilthe specified number is met.


#### Known Issues
1. Fixing a bug that does not allow SL4a to run the script on older android tablets.
2. Still no .exe file version.

Do note that this is a long-term project. This is still in phase 1.
