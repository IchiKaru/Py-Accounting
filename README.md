# Python_In_Action
This is repository whose goal is to record equity and earning income. 
Currently a ice breaker for times when nothing is happening.

### Updates
#### Date: 05/06/2022
1. Cleaner and better code for reading.
2. Made specific variables global such as
  
`global assets list`
`global Current_A_list`
`Current_A_list=[]`
`global Current_A_Value_List`
`Current_A_Value_List=[]`
`global Fixed_A_list`
`Fixed_A_list=[]`
`global Fixed_A_Value_List`
`Fixed_A_Value_List=[]`
`global intangible_A_list`
`intangible_A_list=[]`
`global intangible_A_Value_List`
`intangible_A_Value_List=[]`
`global Current_L_list`
`Current_L_list=[]`
`global Current_L_Value_List`
`Current_L_Value_List=[]`
`global Current_C_list`
`Current_C_list=[]`
`global Current_C_Value_List`
`Current_C_Value_List=[]`
`global user_choice`

3. Splitted the code of the intangible, fixed, and current assets so that I can work on them independently. 
4. Finally prints all of the assets.
